## Conclusion :

From this report, I found that Amazon Company was not at an adequate operating margin as its overall profit percentage was almost 11%. As we can see from the above insights that in many countries, companies have suffered from losses. To recover from this situation Company should focus on the customer behaviour, their requirements and improve its service facilities to get better feedback; otherwise company might be passed out by its competitors if it loses the opportunity. This report and dashboard is helpful for gaining knowledge about the circumstances of the Amazon Company and to do a comparison between its various categories, regions and countries, to know in which Country Amazon is highly popular and in which region it is suffering from loss ,and we can derive other meaningful information according to our requirement from this report.
